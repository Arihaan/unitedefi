## 🚀 Final Contract Deployments

### Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- **Network**: Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111)
- **EscrowFactory**: `0xBe15Ff1F63a6c23Ea7Dd1648d3C16722049d9d37`
- **Resolver**: `0x917999645773E99d03d44817B7318861F018Cb74`
- **Test USDC**: `0xfC47b0FFACC1ef1c6267f06F2A15cDB23a44c93d`

### Celo Alfajores Testnet  
- **Network**: Celo Alfajores (Chain ID: 44787)
- **EscrowFactory**: `0x3095c56e6EbEbC5466632EA3b399F11E50d645cF`
- **Resolver**: `0x917999645773E99d03d44817B7318861F018Cb74`
- **Test USDC**: `0x2F25deB3848C207fc8E0c34035B3Ba7fC157602B`

## 🔧 Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Fixed Token Transfer Flow
- **Issue**: ERC20InsufficientAllowance errors during escrow creation
- **Solution**: Modified EscrowFactory to transfer tokens before escrow initialization
- **Impact**: Enables smooth token handling for cross-chain swaps

### 2. Corrected Timelock Logic
- **Issue**: Double addition of deployedAt timestamp causing withdrawal failures
- **Solution**: Use absolute timestamps directly in timelock checks
- **Impact**: Proper HTLC timelock functionality for atomic swaps

### 3. 1inch Architecture Compliance
- **Implementation**: Real 1inch Limit Order Protocol contracts
- **Features**: Professional resolver model, Dutch auction mechanics, EIP-712 signatures
- **Security**: Hash Time Lock Contracts with safety deposits

## 📊 Demonstration Results

### Successful Cross-Chain Transfer Test
```
🎯 Testing Fixed Contract Implementation
✅ User approved resolver on both networks

✅ Destination escrow created on Celo  
✅ Withdrawal successful with secret reveal
✅ Atomic swap completed successfully
🏆 ALL HACKATHON REQUIREMENTS MET!
```

### Quick Test Validation
```
⚡ Quick Test - Fixed Timelock Logic
✅ Escrow created successfully
✅ Timelock phases working correctly
✅ Withdrawal successful after finality period
✅ Fixed timelock logic confirmed working
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Cross-Chain Atomic Swap Flow
1. **User Initiates**: Approves resolver for token spending on source network
2. **Resolver Creates Source Escrow**: Takes user tokens, creates HTLC on source network
3. **Resolver Creates Destination Escrow**: Provides tokens, creates HTLC on destination network
4. **User Claims**: Reveals secret on destination network to claim tokens
5. **Resolver Claims**: Uses revealed secret to claim tokens on source network
6. **Atomic Guarantee**: Either both succeed or both fail (HTLC safety)

### Key Components
- **EscrowImplementation**: Core HTLC contract with hashlock and timelock logic
- **EscrowFactoryV4**: CREATE2 factory for deterministic cross-chain addresses
- **Mock Resolver**: Professional resolver implementing 1inch resolver role
- **Timelock Phases**: Finality lock → Private withdrawal → Public withdrawal → Cancellation

## 🔒 Security Features

### Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLC)
- **Hashlock**: Secret-based atomic reveal mechanism
- **Timelock**: Multi-phase time-based access control
- **Safety Deposits**: Economic incentives for proper behavior
- **Cancellation**: Fallback mechanism if swap fails

### Timelock Phases
1. **Finality Lock** (0-10s): Brief network finality period
2. **Private Withdrawal** (10-30s): Only intended recipient can withdraw
3. **Public Withdrawal** (30s-5min): Anyone can withdraw for recipient
4. **Private Cancellation** (5-10min): Only maker can cancel
5. **Public Cancellation** (10min+): Anyone can cancel for maker

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (Single Network)
```bash
cd /Users/arihaannegi/Desktop/Hackathons/1inch
node quick-test.js
```

### Full Cross-Chain Test
```bash
cd /Users/arihaannegi/Desktop/Hackathons/1inch
node test-fixed-contracts.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. Fund test accounts with USDC and native tokens
2. Deploy or use existing contract addresses
3. Create escrows on both networks with matching hashlock
4. Reveal secret on destination network
5. Use revealed secret on source network
6. Verify token balances changed correctly
